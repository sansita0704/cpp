    â€¢ Working of above code:
    - The number variable has been read from the console.
    - Then if statement checks if the entered number is between 1 and 5 (inclusive) using the given condition.
    - If the condition is true, the break statement is executed.
    - This terminates the loop and the program continues with the statement written after the body of the loop.
    - If the condition is false, the code inside the if block is skipped.
    - The program executes the statement:
    cout << "Error! Enter a number between 1 and 5." << endl;
    - The loop then continues to the next iteration, repeating the same process again.
